                    <h4>Nebula</h4>
                    <p>A nebula is a large cloud of interstellar dust and gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, located in the space between stars. Nebulae serve as stellar nurseries where new stars are born from collapsing clumps of material, and they can also be the remnants of dying stars, such as from a supernova explosion or a planetary nebula. They are the universe's most visually stunning structures, with fantastical shapes and vibrant colors captured by powerful telescopes like Hubble.</p>

                    <h4>BlackHoles</h4>
                    <p>A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape. This occurs when a massive amount of matter is compressed into an incredibly small space, often during the death of a massive star, leading to a singularity at its center.</p>

                    <p>Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars other than our Sun, with thousands confirmed and more pending discovery. These worlds are diverse, ranging from rocky, Earth-sized planets to massive gas giants and the common "super-Earths" or "mini-Neptunes" not found in our solar system. </p>
