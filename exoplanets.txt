An exoplanet, or extrasolar planet, is a planet outside of our solar system that usually orbits another star in our galaxy.


Most of the exoplanets discovered so far are in a relatively small region of our galaxy, the Milky Way. ("Small" meaning within thousands of light-years of our solar system; one light-year equals 5.88 trillion miles, or 9.46 trillion kilometers.) That is as far as current telescopes have been able to probe. We know from NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope that there are more planets than stars in the galaxy.

Although exoplanets are distant — even the closest known exoplanet to Earth, Proxima Centauri b, is still about 4 light-years away — scientists have discovered creative ways to spot these seemingly tiny objects.
